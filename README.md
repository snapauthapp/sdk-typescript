# SnapAuth TypeScript/JavaScript SDK

### Local Development

Run `npm run watch` to keep the build running continually on file change.

To make the local version available for linking, run `npm link` in this directory.

In the project that should _use_ the local version, run `npm link '@snapauth/sdk'` which will set up the symlinking.
